Exercise2 Question: List the main differences between primitive data type int and class Integer. Be as specific as possible. What are the advantages
of using each one? List all specific functionalities that are available when using one and not the other. 

Answer:

1. The “int” is a primitive data type that is part of the language definition and is passed by value when used as a parameter to a method.

For example: In Java, int is a primitive data type in Java Programming language. Using int data type we can create integer variables 
containing int values. 
             
             int i= 10; //i is an int variable containing primitive nt value 10


2. The "Integer" is a class that has a variety of static “helper” methods for doing things to integers, but it also allows you to create 
objects from its class that contains a single int as the sole field within the object. 

For example: Integer is a wrapper class used to create an object version of a primitive int value. 

            Integer i = new Integer(10); //i is an object of Integer Wrapper class and it contains a primitive int value 10

The specific available functionalities (From the internet website):

1. Type: int is primitive and Integer is object(wrapper class of int).
2. Instantiate: int only by value, but Integer by both value & constructor.
3. Method call: int pass by value, but Integer pass by reference.
4. Conversion: int by type casting, but Integer has its own set of methods(Integer.parseInt of valueOf).
5. Usability: int can’t be used in List or Maps, but Integer can.
